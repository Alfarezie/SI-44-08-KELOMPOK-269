'Cause you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
But I don't really know what I'm sayin'
With you no I don't have to fake it
Don't wanna mess this up
Don't wanna open up

All my excuses are useless
You see right through
Why do I do this?
I'm new to this déjà vu
I'd open up but I don't trust
Yeah, I want to
Cut the excuses
'Cause the truth is
