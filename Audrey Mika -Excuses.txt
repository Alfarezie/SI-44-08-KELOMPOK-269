When you ask where I've been
I said, I'm just sleepin' in, yeah
'Cause I just wanted to talk to you
Didn't know where to begin
Sorry, one sec

'Cause you wanna know what I'm thinkin'
But I don't really know what I'm sayin'
With you no I don't have to fake it
Don't wanna mess this up
Don't wanna open up

All my excuses are useless
You see right through
Why do I do this?
I'm new to this déjà vu
I'd open up but I don't trust
Yeah, I want to
Cut the excuses
'Cause the truth is

Cut the excu-
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Cut the excuses
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Cut the excu-
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na (ooh)

I'm always shuttin' you out, yeah
Each time you're comin' around (sorry)
'Cause every time I get close
Somebody's lettin' me down (ah)
I don't like that
